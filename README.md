Project Description

Research question: Which developed countries are most involved with refugee crises? Is terrorism in countries that host refugees related to the number of refugees they host?

This project will look at refugee and terrorism data from 1990 up to 2016 and will analyze the countries that have taken in the greatest number of refugees. We will use datasets from WorldBank, the UN Refugee Agency and other sources to gather and filter the data on annual refugee movement rates.

The main point of the analysis is to look closely at a selected number of developed host countries after they have open their borders to refugees and to look at the number of terrorist attacks in such countries. The main data on refugees will be filtered to find top 3 developed countries that have taken the biggest number of refugees between 1990 - 2016. In order to make sure that the chosen countries fall under "developed", we will look at:  *changes in GDP* and *unemployment rate*. Next, we will look at the general terrorism dataset and come up with hypothesis that can potentially answer our research question.
